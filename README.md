# Expression-Evaluation-Written-In-Postfix
A simple console application that can solve expressions written in postfix.

## What is a postfix expression?
A postfix expression, also known as Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), is a mathematical notation in which every operator 
follows all of its operands. It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands. 
This notation is particularly useful for computers and calculators because it simplifies the parsing process and 
eliminates the need for operator precedence rules and parentheses. The postfix notation works as follows: 

- Operands are placed before their operators.
- Evaluation proceeds from left to right.
Examples(A B +):
- '3 4 +' is the same as '3 + 4'
- '8 9 3 * +' is the same as '8 + (9 * 3)'
- '4 7 + 3 2 - *' is the same as '(4 + 7) * (3 - 2)'

## Output:
The output will be the postfix expression, the expression, but in infix(a operator b) and the result of the expression.

## Purpose:
The purpose if this project is to exercise the data structure - stack, Git and GitHub skills.
